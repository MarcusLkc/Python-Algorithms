# Pythonpractice

Trying to get back to coding in python after finals prevented me from coding for 2 weeks
It's surpising how much stuff you lose when you aren't coding everyday

This is meant for future use so It becomes easier to reinitiate myself to certain Computer Science topics
Also a great way for me to practice using Algorithms everyday.
